Physical size of the sensors:
**Distance Sensor Sharp** (20-150 cm):

> sensor direction: directly in the relative y-axis of the robot

> x-offset: -115 mm

> y-offset: -130 mm

**Bumpers**

front middle: x 65 mm; y 0 mm

front left: x 65 mm; y 105 mm

front right: x 65 mm; y -105 mm

rear left: x -143 mm; y -95 mm

rear right: x - 135 mm; y 115 mm

Rear left and rear right bumper are not mirrored to detect the minimal distance of the sharp distance sensor.
