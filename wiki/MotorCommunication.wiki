#summary Description of the communication between motors and arduino-board.

= Introduction =

For actuation we use two dynamixel AX-12 servomotors. For Communication they use RS485 Bus, half- duplex.
To control the motors, we used the free Dynamixel_Serial lib, offered by Savage Electronics (http://savageelectronics.blogspot.de/2011/08/actualizacion-biblioteca-dynamixel.html).

To realize the communication, we needed to implement a communication circuit (http://robottini.altervista.org/category/dynamixel).
